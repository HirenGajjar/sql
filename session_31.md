CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS campusx;
```

```

but standard practice is

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS campusx;
```

To create a table you must have a database.

Good practice is to keep the all the keywords capital and all the names for DB, Tables, Rows, Cols small

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table(
user_id INT,
user_name VARCHAR(255),
user_email_address VARCHAR(255),
user_password VARCHAR(255)
);
```

_Data Integrity : accuracy + completeness + consistency = It is to measure a relibility and trustworthiness of the data, dbms and application from errors, corruption and unauthrized access._

1. Constrains (Rules) - conditions
2. Transactions - Example of Bank transactions - a unit of work either executed whole or not at all.
3. Normalization - Design method to reduce redenduncy, and maintain consistency.

---

**Constrains**

1. NOT NULL
2. UNIQUE
3. PRIMARY KEY
4. AUTO INCREAMENT
5. CHECK
6. DEFAULT
7. FOREIGN KEY

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
user_id INT NOT NULL,
user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
user_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
user_password VARHCAR(255) NOT NULL
)
```
