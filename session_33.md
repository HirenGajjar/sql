### Sorting Data

#### DESC

#### ASC

#### Limit x,y

Here is x is offset and y is row count. So if i say LIMIT 4,3 - that means it will ignore 0,1,2,3 and from 4 it will go for 4,5,6 (4 including).

### GROUP

*We use Parent table and categorize it to child tables as many categories we have based on the requirement. And then Perfrom aggregation on them.*

We have to categorize data (by each brand name) in order to find the Each brand and total devices they offer. To do that we make each sub table that gives information for each unique brand name.
